    "The population parameter is a fixed but unknown value that describes the characteristics of the entire population, such as the population mean (μ) or standard deviation (σ). Since measuring the entire population is often impractical, statisticians use sample statistics to estimate these parameters, such as the sample mean ($\\bar x$) estimating the population mean (μ). However, there is a difference between sample statistics and population parameters. Confidence intervals are used to quantify the uncertainty of the sample statistics in estimating the population parameters. A 95% confidence interval indicates that we are 95% confident the true population parameter lies within that range. The bootstrap method is an effective technique for creating confidence intervals by repeatedly resampling from the original sample to simulate the sampling distribution of the statistic, thus determining the range that may contain the population parameter."

    "Population parameters describe the characteristics of an entire population, such as the average height of all students at a university. However, it is often impractical to measure these parameters directly, so we use sample statistics to estimate them. Sample statistics are calculated from a subset of the population, called a sample. For example, the average height of a randomly selected group of students would be a sample statistic.\n",
    "It is important to note that sample statistics are merely estimates of population parameters, and they are likely to differ from the true population values. This difference arises because the sample is only a portion of the population and includes randomness in the selection of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals help us quantify the uncertainty associated with using a sample statistic to estimate a population parameter. A confidence interval provides a range of values within which we believe the true population parameter likely falls. For instance, a 95% confidence interval for the average height of all students might be 160-170 cm. This means we are 95% confident that the true average height of all students lies somewhere within this range.\n",

    "Bootstrapping is a technique to construct confidence intervals by repeatedly resampling from the original sample. By calculating the sample statistic (e.g., the mean) for each resampled dataset, we can simulate the variability of the statistic and estimate the range within which the true population parameter is likely to fall."

    "When the confidence interval includes zero, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, even if the observed sample mean is not zero. This is because the confidence interval represents a range of plausible values for the population parameter, and a zero effect (i.e., the drug has no impact on the average effect) is a reasonable explanation for the observed data. The sample mean may not be exactly zero due to random variation, but if the confidence interval is wide enough to include zero, it indicates that the sample mean is not statistically significantly different from zero. For example, if we are testing a drug to lower blood pressure and our 95% confidence interval is from -5 to -1 mmHg, we can reject the null hypothesis because the entire interval is below zero, indicating a statistically significant reduction in blood pressure."
